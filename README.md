## Work in Progress...
I'm currently playing around with this as a way to learn more about [video capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia), animation, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), and video production. Feel free to follow along or fork for your own learning.

## Goals
A customizable replica of the CNN interface, including:
- animations
- transitions
- sound effects
- multi-user video chat

## Installation
Clone the repo, `npm install`, `npm run dev` and open a browser to [`localhost:3000`](localhost:3000).

## Developing with Svelte
VSCode is currently recommended, with superior formatting and syntax highlighting compared to other IDEs (including JetBrains/WebStorm). Svelte's `.svelte` files and syntax are incredibly intuitive, but refer to [the official documentation](https://svelte.dev) for advanced examples and API reference.
